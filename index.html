        <div class="subheading mb-5">Asian Studies/PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Cassidy Luu, and I am currently a first year student attending the University of California, Riverside, who is majoring in Asian Studies. Although I am an Asian Studies major as of right now, I am planning to switch my major to Psychology. At UCR, I am a member of many student organizations, such as a service fraternity and the Vietnamese Student Association. I am also a research assistant at the Lab of Cognition and Action, headed by Professor David Rosenbaum. In the past, I attended a Chinese School, and through Chinese School, I participated in and volunteered for many cultural events. For example, throughgout elementary, middle school, and high school, I participated in various Chinese speech and poem recitation contests. I also performed traditional Chinese dances and sang Chinese opera as a way to introduce Chinese culture to non-Chinese people. I also play the piano. Being a musician has given the opportunity to take part in many recitals and piano competitions. Lastly, I used to dance. Specifically, I did ballet and pointe. Being a dancer, like being a musician, gave me the opportunity to attend many recitals and competitions. It has also taught me how to work with a team. <br><br>

        Throughout high school, I maintained a 4.1 GPA, and I graduated high school magna cum laude and with honors. I would say that I am an efficient worker, and I do not do my work last minute. I am also trilingual, speaking Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. I also know a little bit of Spanish, since I studied the language all four years of high school. However, I am not fluent in Spanish, unlike how I am fluent in the other three languages I know how to speak. Additionally, I have volunteer experience. I have volunteered a a summer camp, where I looked after younger children and taught them how to read and write Chinese. I have also volunteered at a food bank, where I packed food boxes that would be distributed to those who were in need. I have also had a summer internship at an engineering firm, where I mostly took phone calls as a receptionist and filed papers. Although I have no plans to become an engineer, working at an engineering firm gave me a real world job experience, and it taught me how to present myself in a professional manner.<br><br>

        Although I do not have much work experience as of right now, I am eager to learn. I am a quick learner, and so I will pick things up very quickly. I am also responsible, meaning that I will complete all the tasks assigned to me on time and of the highest quality I can achieve. I am also very open-minded, and so I am willing to listen to and accept other people's opinions. In other words, I work well in teams because I am a good listener and collaborator.In addition, I am open to accepting feedback and constructive criticism. I understand that feedback is necessary to grow and produce better work.
